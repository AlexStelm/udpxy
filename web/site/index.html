            <h3>Introduction:</h3>
            <p><i>udpxy</i> is a UDP-to-HTTP multicast traffic relay daemon: it forwards UDP traffic from a given multicast subscription to the requesting HTTP client.</p>
            <p><i>udpxy</i> is free and open source: it is licensed under GPL v.3. It was written to build on POSIX-compliant systems, with the minumum of efforts, external dependencies and configuration rues (so far, it's been building fine without <i>autoconf</i> or <i>cmake</i>).
            <p><i>udpxy</i> is made to be able to run on devices with limited (compared to modern PC's) resources. The original <i>udpxy</i> was designed to run on a router with a 100 MHz CPU and 32Mb of RAM. The <i>code</i> is kept <i>simple</i> and the <i>memory footprint</i> is kept <i>small</i>.</p>
            <p><i>In fact, we believe that newer software should run faster even on <s>old</s> aged hardware.</i></p>

            </p>Most builds have been known to compile and run on Linux 2.4, 2.6 and 3.0, and FreeBSD from version 5.5 and up, on x86, amd64 and ARM architectures; some builds haven been tested on HP-UX 11.11 (PA-RISC2.0w) - just to make sure they <i>could</i> run there. Generally, there are no platform restrictions (other than <i>POSIX compliance</i>) and no platform dependencies either. Currently, Linux and BSD derivatives are the primary build targets and, thus, receive the most of attention and support.</p>
